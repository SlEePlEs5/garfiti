A gamified messaging app.
To send a message to a friend, first take a photo, then type a Subject and a Hidden-message.
When your friend receives the message, they immediately see the photo and the Subject. 
To reveal your Hidden-message, they must replicate the photo by taking a similar photo themselves.

Optionally, messages may be associated with the location where the photo was taken.

The app may use email and/or a server-backend for message transmission.

Image comparison is our biggest challenge. Early versions will "fake it until we make it."

As much as possible, developed for cross-platform distribution (Android, iOS), using: 
- phonegap
